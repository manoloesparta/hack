# Implementation of the HACK Chipset

- [x] Logic Gates
- [x] Arithmetic Logic Unit

## Acknowledgement

Originally this was about constructing the machine described in the book "The Elements of Computing Systems" in pure C. Everything was ok until chapter 3 was reachead and the sequential logic chips/gates were introduced, I haven't found a solution for implementing in an atomic way which puts me in the position of halting this project.
